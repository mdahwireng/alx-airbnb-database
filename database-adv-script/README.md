# Advanced Querying Power

## Inroduction

This project is a part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, it implements advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database. It demonstrate hands-on experience with database management and performance tuning by real-world challenges like optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and indexing and partitioning.

## Features

1. **Advanced SQL:** Complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations for data retrieval and analysis.
   
2. **Query Performance Optimization:** Analysis and refactoring of SQL scripts using performance tools like **EXPLAIN** and **ANALYZE**.
   
3. **Indexing and Partitioning:** Applying indexing and table partitioning to improve database performance for large datasets.
   
4. **Monitoring and Refining Performance:** Continuously monitoring database health and refining schemas and queries for optimal performance.
   
5. **DBA:** Making data-driven decisions about schema design and optimization strategies for high-volume applications.


## Scripts:
- **`joins_queries.sql`**: Contains queries using different types of joins.


- **`subqueries.sql`**: Includes both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
- **`aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`**: SQL aggregation and window functions for data analysis.
- **`performance_optimization.sql`**: Contains scripts for performance tuning using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` by  refactoring complex queries
- **`partitioning.sql`**: Demonstrates table partitioning techniques for large datasets.
